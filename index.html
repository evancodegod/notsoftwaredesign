    The software development process is a list consisting of 5 steps which gives you an outline on how someone should go about handling their design project. Its 5 steps are requirements, design, implementation, verification, and maintenance. The requirements stage involves communicating with your client or peers on questions involving the project such as who this software is for or what is this software solving. Design stage is the step where the plan on how to answer the previous questions is developed. The implementation stage is when the programming begins and the plan from the previous step is put into action. The verification, also referred to as the testing stage, is self-explanatory, and it involves testing the implemented code and has the developer creating test cases to verify and validate the code they developed. Lastly the last step maintenance is done when the software is finished and has been given/ installed for the client who requested it, it has the developer just maintaining and keeping track of the software in case any issues come up for the clients. Software design is an important part of software development because it gives the developer a way to collect their thoughts and provides an outline of how the project is going to go before they start which will prevent anything from interfering with itself in the project. A software I use that I believe was well designed is Spotify. I say this because Spotify has a nice dark theme and easy to navigate UI. Spotify also has features in it that someone would not expect themself to want until they find it such as the sleep timer which will stop playing music after a specified amount of time to prevent music from playing all night after you have fallen asleep.

    What happens during the requirement stage is the software developer is asking their client questions about the software they’re developing and the requirements around it. These questions can be related to things such as development restrictions such as what language they want the software to be programmed in or what operating system they want to be able to run on. Other specificiations also need to be noted such as what measurement units they might want to be used or how they want the user interface to look. This stage is an important step in the entire developmental process because it sets up the groundwork for the later steps of the software development process and creates a relationship with the client. 

As an ordinary user, I want the software to allow the creation of playlists, so that the user can organize their music. 

As an ordinary user, I want to see constant recommendations of new music, so that the user can discover new music easily. 

As an ordinary user, I want a feature to set a timer that turns off the music once it finishes, so that the user can fall asleep to music without it going all night. 

As an ordinary user, I want the user interface to have a calm dark theme to it, so that the user interface looks nice and isn’t too bright for the eyes 

As the business owner, I want the software to have limitations blocked by a monthly pay wall, so that users can get a taste of what they’re missing out on and purchase our product.

    The elements of empathy include awareness/ sensitivity/ experiencing the feelings, thoughts and unique experiences of other people being communicated to you and the ability to understand a person or group’s subjective experience without having to experience it yourself. 

The three business models are “sheep”, “homo economicus”, and “tasks and goals”. The issue with the sheep model is the organizations focus their energy and resources on the design of their products instead of the marketing which creates a divide between market and design which leads to costumer disappointment, and it creates a rude view of their customer base. The homo economicus model has its issue in the understanding of what the customer base wants. This model has the organization trying to add as many features as they can to their products because they believe it's in the best interest of their customers, but it actually has a negative effect on their sales. The final model “tasks and goals” is flawed because of its focus on the optimization of their products which results in the organization forgetting about the usability of their product for their customer base. 

The sheep model lacks the sensitivity element of empathy because of its disrespectful nature caused by the lack of care for an organization's customer base. Homo economicus lacks the understanding element of empathy which can be seen in the blender example from the textbook. The blender company thinks their customers want as many features as possible, but they really just want an effective blender. Finally, the “tasks and goals” model misses the ability to understand a person/ group’s subjective experience without having to experience it themself. I say this because the textbook references an example where a company designed diapers without imagining how a mother would be able to do it one handed by herself.
