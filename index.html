    The software development process is a list consisting of 5 steps which gives you an outline on how someone should go about handling their design project. Its 5 steps are requirements, design, implementation, verification, and maintenance. The requirements stage involves communicating with your client or peers on questions involving the project such as who this software is for or what is this software solving. Design stage is the step where the plan on how to answer the previous questions is developed. The implementation stage is when the programming begins and the plan from the previous step is put into action. The verification, also referred to as the testing stage, is self-explanatory, and it involves testing the implemented code and has the developer creating test cases to verify and validate the code they developed. Lastly the last step maintenance is done when the software is finished and has been given/ installed for the client who requested it, it has the developer just maintaining and keeping track of the software in case any issues come up for the clients. Software design is an important part of software development because it gives the developer a way to collect their thoughts and provides an outline of how the project is going to go before they start which will prevent anything from interfering with itself in the project. A software I use that I believe was well designed is Spotify. I say this because Spotify has a nice dark theme and easy to navigate UI. Spotify also has features in it that someone would not expect themself to want until they find it such as the sleep timer which will stop playing music after a specified amount of time to prevent music from playing all night after you have fallen asleep.
